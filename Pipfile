# TIP:  If you want to test local changes to SpiffWorkflow, do:
# pipenv install --editable ../SpiffWorkflow (but fix things back before commiting!)
# Merged Commit https://github.com/sartography/SpiffWorkflow/pull/178 broke usage of SpiffWorkflow
# References to task states will need to be updated to allow using newest version
